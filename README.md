# Tink I/O - asynchronous I/O everywhere

This library provides a number of helpers for I/O:
  
- Buffer - a circular buffer for binary data
- Worker - a lightweight abstraction of an I/O worker, which is compatible with tink.runloop.Worker
- Sink - an asynchronous output sink
- Source - an asynchronous input source
- IdealSource - an asynchronous input source that will not fail
- Pipe - can pipe a sink into a source

More documentation to come.
